# Day 1 - small molecule reflection

Day was divided to three main tasks: Protein Mix Cell Harvest, Amino Acid Mix, and Small Molecule Mix. The day ended with assembling a reaction with control PURE components and in-house made small molecule mix.

### Technical notes:
1. The strain used for protein mix growth is BL21 with a modification of LysY for stricter LacI repression -- because repression control is stronger, batch to batch variation of expression strengh is low.
2.Don't add water first to a master mix -- proteins don't respond well if added directly to water
3. induction lasted 2.5 hours ( but longer should be ok theoretically)
4. A new approach to store cell pellet for me is to scoop the cells with spatula from the bottom of the tube after spinning down. Put the cell pellet through the bottom of a ziplog bag and use the fingers to press the cell pellet to the bag. After getting all the biomass in the bag, use fingers to thin down the ziploc bag. Then flash freeze in -80.

Most of the procedures in the workshop I have not done before personally but only know the idea theoretically, so I enjoyed learning the process of doing it myself. I also appreciated a lot the experience of talking to others about both big-picture ideas, exchanging research interests, and sharing experiences on smaller techinques (eg. what solvent to dissolve amino acid in ??) It was a very rewarding day


# Day 2 - protein mix reflection

The whole day was dedicated to making protein mixes, which definitley ended up longer than I expected. It was my first time doing protein purification. 

Our 8 samples underwent different stages of sonication. I noticed a drastic difference in the sonication settings done in our lab vs. the protocol here. We use 50% Amplitude, 20Hz, 5s on, 5s off and ~1000J per 1.5mL, on an ice-water slurry to ensure immediate heat dissipation of the lysate. The protocol here is 25% Amplitube, 15sec on, 30sec off, and sonicate with metal tube holders in ice. I believe that there is a bigger chacne of heat damage to the proteins due to longer continuous lysis time and incomplete heat dissipation. A point was made to me that heat damage to proteins is done mostly by instataneous input of energy, not accumulation of heat.

However, after sonication for the same time 2x(2:45min, ~1000J) for a 10mL sample, our lysates have a big difference in viscosity and color. Some of us went through a third stage of sonication, mine did not. 

After spinning down, we need to get rid of the imidazole, which is a salt which is an inhibitor for PURE reaction. My sample went through eight spins over a course of ~5 hours.

| Spin # | Spin time(min) | Pre-spin Volume | Post-spin Volume | Dilution factor | Nanodrop A280 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 20 | 15 | 2.5 | 6x |
| 2 | 50 | 15 | 900 | 16x |
| 3 | 45 | 15 | 550 | 3.5x |
| 4 | 15 | 2 | 550 | -- |
| 5 | 5 | 0.55 | 0.35 | -- |
| 6 | 5 | 0.35 | 0.175 | -- |
| 7 | 5 | 0.35(Add 0.175 storage buffer) | 0. | -- |
| 8 | 3 | 23 |


### Technical notes:
1. Add TCEP right before every step that requires addition of buffers
2. A280 overestimates protien concentration
3. Storage Buffer is NOT needed if you're planning to use the protein DAY OF.
