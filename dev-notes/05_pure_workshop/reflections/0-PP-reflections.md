# Day 1 - small molecule reflection
To meet the energy demands of protein synthesis, the PURE system uses a defined energy mix that includes nucleoside triphosphates and regeneration components—typically 2 mM ATP, 2 mM GTP, 1 mM CTP, and 1 mM UTP, along with 20 mM creatine phosphate and creatine kinase to recycle ATP from ADP. Through this process, I learned which reagents are most critical for supporting energy metabolism in the system. I had been making my energy mix differently before, but this experience introduced me to a potentially more effective formulation and concentrations. Based on what I saw in our experiments—and in comparison with my colleagues' results. I also realized that the failure of the homemade PURE system is likely not due to the energy mix.
# Day 2 - protein mix reflection
The protein mix in the PURE system consists of a carefully assembled set of individually purified proteins that are crucial for processes like transcription, translation, aminoacylation, and energy regeneration. Through our experiments, I realized that one possible reason for the failure of our homemade PURE system could be related to the ratios and concentrations of proteins in the mix—our measurements showed a consistently low yield. Something I hadn’t expected was the challenge we faced during sonication, which might have affected protein assay. Interestingly, we also observed a blue protein in the b.next control, which was unexpected and definitely caught our attention. Also, I learned that I should add Tcep into buffers right before each single step.
# Day 3 - rescue the protein mix by drop ins
We conducted a series of experiments to troubleshoot the issue of low protein yields in our PURE system assays. Utilizing a LabChip analyzer, we examined the composition of the protein mix, which provided insightful data. Based on these findings, we supplemented the system with additional EF-Tu, an essential elongation factor, and IF2, a key initiation factor. This adjustment led to a modest improvement in protein yield; however, the results still fell short when compared to the positive control.
# Day 4 - rescue the protein mix by dialysis
Since rescuing the protein mix didn’t significantly improve the yield of the PURE reaction, we started to suspect that something in the buffer itself might be interfering with the system. To test this idea, we dialyzed the buffer to remove any potentially harmful substances and designed a series of experiments to investigate the hypothesis. The results were promising—we saw a noticeable improvement in protein yield compared to the original mix. However, the yield was still considerably lower than what we’d expect from a fully functional system positive control. We hypothesized that we can make it better by adjusting the amount of Magnesium. 
# Day 5 - assemble PURE
We set up a comprehensive series of experiments using our own reagent solutions and a magnesium concentration sweep to finally get a clearer picture of what was going wrong. I also had the chance to work with Yen-Yu on GUV-encapsulated PURE experiments, which was a great experience. We spent time discussing and troubleshooting the low yields we were seeing in those encapsulated systems, which gave me valuable insights into the challenges of working with synthetic cells.

# How to take these learnings back home? 

- What challenges might you expect? Forgetting about some details that seem unimportant but they are important.

- What details did you learn here that would be useful? As a mechanical engineer I learned a lot of things! It was my frst time to purify tRNAs and Ribosomes! 

- What kind of support would be useful? Maybe office-hours upon request

# Reflections on the workshop?

- What was your favorite moment? I enjoyed every single moment and I learned a lot from other people in this field! Being able to do liposome experiments with Yen-Yu during the last day was really great!!

- What was your least favorite moment? When I saw the result of protein mix measurments!
