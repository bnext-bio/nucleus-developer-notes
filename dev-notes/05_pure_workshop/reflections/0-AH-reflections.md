# Day 1 - small molecule reflection
The small molecule mix was much more fincky than I expected. I was surprised at how low the activity was for all of the mixes we made compared to the control. Over the course of the week I had many fantastic conversations with other workshop members and b.next people about how they make their amino acid stocks in their labs now and different methods they've used previously. I think this is the component that I am most excited to experiment with once I go home, primarily by trying different methods of resuspension along with different concentrations of KOH and whether or not the KOH resuspended amino acids are pH adjusted or added directly to the energy mix with the asssumption that the buffer can tolerate it. We also discussed that the concentration of amino acids in PURE is significantly lower than TxTl despite there being less available amino acids from other sources. Worth trying a TxTl energy mix concentration? Final thoughts, interesting discussions on freeze/thaw cycles and energy mix performance along with the idea of making it fresh from aliquots of each component immediately before running a large experiment. 

# Day 2 - protein mix reflection
The purification was something I was familiar with and I don't feel like there were any big surprises on this day for me. I did really enjoy the conversation about all the different methods people use to speed up flow through on the column. The serological pipette trick was new to me and something I will probably use in the future. Protein concentration wise, I started to have issues with protein crashing out around 28mg/ml which is good to note for myself in the future, I will stop concentrating before I get to this point, add the storage supplement and then continue concentration. Also interesting was the conversation on whether or not everyone flash freezes everything (or at least biomolecules) prior to placing them in the -80C. 

# Day 3 - rescue the protein mix by drop ins
I think having a protein mix that did not perform well resulted in us getting much stronger training. I think it was super helpful to troubleshoot something as a group as we got to hear a lot of different ideas as well as many different people's experiences working with some of these proteins etc. Having protein aliquots available to spike in is extremely helpful and I already have the capability to do this for most proteins. I knew low EF-Tu was a common cause of low activity but was less familar with IF2, T7, and ArgRS as potential problem proteins. It is super helpful to know these are good first steps if I need to troubleshoot protein expression in the future. It did also make me seriously consider traditional 36 pot PURE as well. 

# Day 4 - rescue the protein mix by dialysis
This was a super fun day and I would not usually think of something toxic in the buffer, I would have likely decided I had poor activity of proteins and just redone the purification which would have resulted in the same systematic buffer issue with the second purification. I am having a hard time tracing exactly how something got into the buffers that has this dramatic of an effect but this was an easy thing to test and it is simple to remake buffers. We also tested tRNAs today and I really enjoyed all of the conversation around this topic and different purification steps. I think the conversation around the differences in ions for NEB reagents vs homemade reagents was super interesting. I found this arguement compelling and would love to see and experiement in the future where dialyzed tRNAs vs undialyzed tRNAs are tested with different combinations of commerical and homemade protein mixes and energy mixes.

# Day 5 - assemble PURE
Excited to see what this data looks like. I think at this point in the week, I feel confident that I have the knowledge I need to recreate what I learned here in my home lab. I also feel comfortable with a wide variety of potential troubleshooting options. I do think it will still take a while to get functional PURE but I feel reasonably confortable with what that will take and feel that I have the knowledge and support to do this. Side quest note - did not like the protein concentration kit that I tested this afternoon (kit was something Orange?), the range of concentrations that the asssay detects are incredibly low which I think suits a different objective from quanitify a highly concentrated protein mix. Starting dilution was 3000x from the working concentration in PURE. 


# How to take these learnings back home? 

- What challenges might you expect?

I think the overall challenge will be the "death by a thousand cuts" that we discussed throughout the week. From that perspective, I am a little bit nervous about pH as the pH probe in my lab is less sensitive than the one here. I also anticipate the energy mix to take some optimization. Despite the challenges we had with the protein mix this week, I am comfortable with gravity column purifications and so feel relatively confident with that component, I am very confortable with the tRNA prep and also feel that my lab has a good set up to do the ribosome purification. Overall I think it will be all about optimization and adjusting to exactly what I have available in my lab to get a PURE that is active enough to use as an NEB replacement. 

- What details did you learn here that would be useful?

I think I gained a greater appreciate for just how sensitive each component is as well as how difficult it can be to get the different components to play nice together. Mg2+, mg2+. Mg2+ (along with all the other salts)!!!! Especially the perspective of a prep that appears to perform poorly may actually work great afer a Mg2+ titration. 

- What kind of support would be useful?

  I feel like the combination of the workshop slack, the office hours, and the offer to send various components from b.next to use as standards feels like a solid support system to get this up in my lab. 

# Reflections on the workshop?

- What was your favorite moment?

  I had a ton of fun this week! More than anything else, the conversations with everyone at b.next and the other workshop participants were incredible. I can't think of any other time I've had the opportunity to spend this much time with others working on such similar science and to actually get to do benchwork with people from other labs. I think it resulted in a level of conversation and discussion of all sorts of technical methods/techniques that you would not ever get otherwise. I think this more than anything else is the most valuable thing I will take from the week. 

- What was your least favorite moment?

  Not necessarily less favorite moment but I personally would have been interested to see all of the ribosome protocol (or at least from the point of filter lysate to sucrosse cushion I have not done a lot of FLPC and would have enjoyed getting to see it once from someone who is comfortable with the technique)
