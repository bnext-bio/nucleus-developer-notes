# Day 1 - small molecule reflection
The translation activity of our PURE system supplemented with the small molecule mix we prepared was low.
I feel like the composition of the energy mix in the Workshop SMS is quite different from that of NEB’s mix.

# Day 2 - protein mix reflection
You don't need to wash the membrane when using an Amicon filter.

# Day 3 - rescue the protein mix by drop ins
The enhancement of translation by dialyzing the tRNA was minimal.

# Day 4 - rescue the protein mix by dialysis
Rescuing the protein mix by dialysis was observed, but the effect was limited.

# Day 5 - assemble PURE
Based on the experiment from the previous day, it's clear that dialysis has an effect, but it's extremely limited. Since EF-Tu, IF2, and T7 RNAP are clearly important for PURE system activity, I thought it would be best to start by supplementing the PURE system with these three factors at the same concentrations as in the NEB mix to see if the activity can be rescued. The amount of EF-Tu can be quantified and directly compared with NEB, while for T7 RNAP and IF2—since they have similar molecular weights and the amounts are not clear—we should titrate them to determine the optimal concentrations. The activity likely won’t be fully restored, so I also thought it would be a good idea to group the translation factors randomly (e.g., ARS groups 1, 2, 3; energy regeneration factors, etc.) and test which group enhances translation activity. From there, we can narrow down further to identify the key contributing factors.

# How to take these learnings back home? 

- What challenges might you expect?
I realized that achieving consistent expression levels in the one-pot system is more challenging than I expected. Also, since it’s a one-pot setup, it’s difficult to freely adjust specific factors.

- What details did you learn here that would be useful?
It was great to learn about the difference in protein expression levels of the one-pot PURE system and the protein composition of the NEB mix.

- What kind of support would be useful?
Supply of E. coli strains and plasmids.

# Reflections on the workshop?

- What was your favorite moment?
I’m glad I was able to understand the E. coli culture steps, which are especially important for the purification of the one-pot PURE system.

- What was your least favorite moment?
Access to E. coli strains and plasmids used for the one-pot PURE system would be extremely helpful. These resources would allow me to replicate the baseline system more faithfully and serve as a foundation for further optimization or customization.
