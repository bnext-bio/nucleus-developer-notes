TG - 3 Rounds sonication (insert cycle params here) did not obsserve the "tan" phenotype of good lysis compared to control

TG- Blue or violet pellet in B.next control. Unclear why. Most likely suspicion is nickle carryover, it was the only one with a reused filter. 

- JS: 0.5 L growth was prepared in a 2 L *baffled* flask TB w/o glycerol or glucose. O/N cultures (LysY LacIQ) were prepared in deep well plate, except EF-Tu, which is needed in larger volume. Equal amounts of all cultures (except EF-Tu) were used for inoculation.

- JS: identify likely failure points in making energy mix:
    - tyrosine solubility (cannot prepare as stock >1x)
    - spermidine instability (unstable as powder, more stable in aq. at -80)

- JS: Efficacy of energy mixes was tested by mixing them will all NEB components in the first test seen below {ref}`fig:ref-day1-kinetics`. All energy mixes fail to match NEB controls, but clearly have some activity.

-TG energy mix freeze thawing was discussed

- JS: Following protein spike in tests, it became clear that buffers / small molecule contaminants were a much more likely source of error, which became the focus of day 4 testing. The simplest control was to add a small amount of our protein mix to an NEB reaction, which we refer to as a *poisoning experiment.* The clear effect of our protein mix in this control made it much more likely that a persistent contaminant was driving our problems. In the hopes of solving this, we dialyzed a large pool of the purified protein into fresh buffer O/N.

**JS FIGURE COMMENT** Do we want to make NEB controls visible so we can evaluate our results in terms of how close to NEB solution A we are?

Resuspension:
- Thaw and resuspend 2 g of cell biomass in 18 mL of Extraction Buffer (50 mM sodium acetate, 10 mM magnesium acetate, pH 5.0).

Phenol Extraction:

- Add 18 mL of acid phenol (pH 4.5), incubate at 37°C with shaking for 30 minutes.

- Centrifuge at 4,000 rcf at 4°C for 15 minutes.

Second Extraction:

- Add 14 mL of Extraction Buffer to the collected aqueous phase.

- Repeat phenol extraction.

Carefully collect the upper aqueous layer, which contains the nucleic acids.
- JS: Wanted to test if failure of one-pot protein pools was due to protein issues, or buffer issues (alternative hypothesis exist, but these two are the most obvious). Day 3 focused on protein based problems, buffer questions were pushed to day 4 and 5
- JS: Spike ins were based on typical problematic proteins:
    - T7RNAP
    - ArgAS
    - EF-Tu
    - IF2
- JS: The above proteins were spiked in alone, or in combination in different ratios. There was concern that adding too much spike in would be deleterous so care was needed to test different amounts
- JS: Examining the data {ref}`fig:ref-day4-kinetics` shows that although some spike ins improved PURE activity by as much as 2-3 fold, we still failed to capture even 1% of NEB control suggesting protein spike ins were not the crux of the problem

Folinic acid (5-formyl-THF) is one of the components in Energy Mix, the small molecule components of PURE reactions, and is crucial to the production of N-formylmethionine (fMet) by the enzyme Methionyl-tRNA formyltransferase (MTF). fMet is a modified amino acid required for translation initiation in bacterial systems like PURE. However, folinic acid cannot be used directly by MTF and first has to be converted into 10-formyltetrahydrofolate (10-formyl-THF). This process happens in two steps: (1) folinic acid is converted (chemically or enzymatically) to an intermediate product 5,10-methenyl-THF, which then (2) spontaneously hydrolyzes into 10-formyl-THF ({ref}`fig:FA_metabolism`).



Implied protocol (from [Lavickova *et al.* 2019](https://doi.org/10.1021/acssynbio.8b00427
)):

- Dissolve folinic acid in water or DMSO.
- (No further processing suggested)
