General not day specific reflection:
Overarching note while not practical and understandable to leave out, finer details on prepared beforehand steps (maybe a video, or maybe quick in lab mock walkthrough of actual stock materials) would help for even "simple" buffer making, energy solution resuspension, culuture setup etc..

# Day 1 - small molecule reflection

Workshop Refection:
Small molecule 
Rollout was great, and Sunday/Monday strong way to start

see notes below on AA mix. I would like to see this resolved with experiments showing activity or discussed more instead of each group making their own way

Personal Project Relevance Refelection
Amino acid mix: was interested in the methodology as I have had difficulties with amino acid precipitation and have discussed several protocols including making all in water yielding a heterogeneous mix, 1-5 M KOH which is homogenous (possibly until pHing down), or more complex protocols timing each addition and separating tyrosine for this reason. Different experts I have talked to have conflicting strong opions on why not to do the other. 

Small energy mix: was interested in the methodology as I have had difficulties with strange precipitates making energy mix more or less as described in Nucleus, but with some alterations for mycoplasma lysate CFE. Unfortunately many were prepared beforehand, so did not get to see that, but somewhat gained confidence in making it. 2-4X worse than most other preparations leaves some implication of human error that was not possible to dive deeper on a personal level, but with magnesium sweeping not being implemented and protein mix problems of their own, difficult to tell. 

# Day 2 - protein mix reflection

Workshop Refection:


Personal Project Relevance reflection:

Great take homes all throughout the protocol. With no prior experience, aside from the inherent difficulties encountered, I am confident in producing our own protein mix, as well as implement lessons for cell free (growth, lysis, dialysis).

# Day 3 - rescue the protein mix by drop ins

Workshop Refection:
Unhinged but 

Personal Project Relevance reflection:


Drop ins 

# Day 4 - rescue the protein mix by dialysis

Personal Project Relevance refection:

# Day 5 - assemble PURE

Personal Project Relevance refection:

# How to take these learnings back home? 

- What challenges might you expect?

- What details did you learn here that would be useful?

- What kind of support would be useful? 

# Reflections on the workshop?

- What was your favorite moment?

- What was your least favorite moment?

- Interested in opinion on the breaking point of when to decide to do a complete restart. It may have been mentioned on Day 3 after rescuing did not work?
