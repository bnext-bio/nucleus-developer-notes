# Day 1 - small molecule reflection
Was very nice that a lot of the buffers were pre-made, if I venture to teach this workshop I will definitely do the same
Amino acid solutions and solubility is a big question - I tried the OnePot method where 19 solutions + dry tyrosine are mixed before, and it worked ok for me, but doing it in the lab is tedious. Magnesium is definitely a factor, and it's a shame that we didn't do a magnesium sweep until Friday, I think even with NEB Solution B a magnesium sweep earlier on would have been informative. It might not have been the optimal for our protein mix, but it would help understand the variability to expect from a magnesium optimisation. 

# Day 2 - protein mix reflection

Long day of gravity columns and amicon concentrators. Would be nice to see and SDS-PAGE as well. Maybe do EF-Tu and If2 spike-ins from the beginning, if we know that's the porblem (36 pot porpaganda here). Or a workflow of purify -> PAGE/labchip -> decide what to spike in -> assemble reactions (with unspiked controls ofc).

# Day 3 - rescue the protein mix by drop ins

I was doing tRNA that day, so I completely missed the spike in brainstorming and setup, but the data was super interesting to watch. tRNA day was complicated by people queueing for the hood, so we were off schedule a lot. Would be nice to activity test tRNA right away as well. 

# Day 4 - rescue the protein mix by dialysis

Note to self - fresh dialysis and storage buffer
Would love to do more of the ribosome purification protocol. 
Interesting what of the buffer can actually poison the reaction, or can it be something that co-purified


# Day 5 - assemble PURE

I keep thinking about 36-parameter space optimization (36 pot propaganda), but it seems absolutely not feasible to do in terms of volume/amount of reactions; With Echo pipetting and microassay fluorescent readout - 1ul PURE reactions to optimize in 36+ parameter space? (irrelevant thoughts)


# How to take these learnings back home? 

- What challenges might you expect?

Not having FPLC set up for ribosomes; Being stuck in an eternal loop of co-culture proportions optimizations; One of the reagents being from a different supplier and throwing everything off

- What details did you learn here that would be useful?

- What kind of support would be useful?
I really like the idea of office hours, just having someone to ask if I run into a problem
DNA distribution is massively helpful
Having a flow of information about what you guys tried/optimized and what didn't work, so I don't try the same thing
