# Day 1 - small molecule reflection
+ Great start to the day
+ Awesome to see people exploring the space; all the hard work setting it up paying off.
+ Amazing to see the energy mix work, the day after
+ Wasn't too much in the lab, helping with tech, etc.
+ Much less effort required for basic TA-ing etc.

# Day 2 - protein mix reflection
+ Day to build out infrastructure while everyone did proteins
+ Technology; jupyterhub. Set up the livestream so we can follow the data in realtime.
+ Felt pretty chill, until we got the results back--live
+ Disappointing (though we're more used to it). How could we pivot/fix?
    + But also an opportunity to teach the debug skills we've learned--what could be wrong?

# Day 3 - rescue the protein mix by drop ins
+ Do we even have the drop ins? This seems fraught--many moving parts.
+ Wish we'd saved some of the cell pellets for either another round of purification or a debug using PCR or something else.
+ Big set up on the lab chip; worked a lot more smoothly than last time. Awesome to see this data for OnePot.
+ Great to run through the Jupyter/DevNote workflow with people. Found a few bugs, prototyped how to work through it, great to be working with real data from the previous couple of days.
+ Would have been good to have nice fresh protein mix data. Instead got delayed debugging, and decided not to run the magnesium sweep (probably a great idea).

# Day 4 - rescue the protein mix by dialysis
+ Gave it a try with the other team--figured it might help. It didn't.
+ Might not be buffers; alternatively, might be that even our stock buffers have the same problem. Either way, at least we're doing reps on two key ways to debug PURE including the poisioning experiment.
+ These two days of experiments are seriously powered with the collaboration of everyone. Lots of different conditions.

# Day 5 - assemble PURE
+ Biggest plate we've ever run.
+ Early results look confusing.
+ Chiller day--awesome calm collaborative energy assembling these huge reactions.

# How to take these learnings back home? 

- What challenges might you expect?
  - Need to debug DNA, need to debug buffers

- What details did you learn here that would be useful?
    - Workshop is an even more powerful way of bringing people together than I had expected.
    - Learned a ton about how to run a workshop better, quick tune ups, need for deeply validated reagents as well as spare reagents for fun side experiments.
    - We got far more done than I expected we would/could.

- What kind of support would be useful?
    - Need to keep the community together in the post.

# Reflections on the workshop?

- What was your favorite moment?
    - Late night jams and early morning syncs

- What was your least favorite moment?
    - Seeing the protein data failing on Tuesday night and wondering what to do.
