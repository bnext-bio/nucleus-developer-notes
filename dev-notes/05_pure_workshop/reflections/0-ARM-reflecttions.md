# Day 1 - small molecule reflection
There was a plan and we seemed to be sticking to it. At the end of the day energy mix came back well enough. Severine had an above average energy mix prep which would likley be explain by pipetting a hypothesis later to be confirmed?

# Day 2 - protein mix reflection

These results were crushing. The day went way longer than planned. All of the PURE reactions were on the floor and we wanted to know why. We had planned for an experiment to do a magnesium sweep but this seemed like the totally wrong approach. The approach should have been to accommodate for the unexpected and to create space for co-creation. Unfortunately it was difficult to balance the responsibility of having 8 new people in our space while also creating room for creativity and improvisation. What emerged though was trust and and an ability to work with each other and a sense of shared purpose to fix and debug these protein mixes. 

# Day 3 - rescue the protein mix by drop ins

I think the red team had a very different experieince since they were in the chute of running tRNA until the end of the day. Whereas blue team had the space for data analsyis and was able to design an experiment to rescure the proteins by piushihng on one of two different hypothesis. Either there were missing proteins or the buffer was contaminated. A third possibility was suspicion around the plasmids themselves. Blue team designed an experiment that explored several different potential dropout proteins and see if those recovered the function. 

The results were mildly encouraging but we were still at the floor. It did not seem like proteins were the issue, we also ran the lab chip to assess proteins and they all seemed to be there. At this point the schedule was entirely out the window. 


# Day 4 - rescue the protein mix by dialysis

Blue team started with ribosomes and then had to move into tRNA this was a grueling day that last until 9 at least. Read team had the opportunity now to carry on the experiment and rescure PURE by looking at dialysis and buffer exchange

We also continued to see significant variance in pierce 660 data suggesting that workshop conditions require rethinking how these assays are run. 

A side experiment emerged which questioned whether or not tRNA actually needed an overnight dialysis step. I think the answer to this question is no, but I need to follow up on the data

At the watch party it looked like the OnePot preps poisoned NEB PURE and and that buffer exchange looked to be helping. This was encouraging to find out a solution. The end result was a late night experiment to prepare a new dialysis buffer and buffer exchange all the proteins so that they could be ready for tomorrow.

# Day 5 - assemble PURE

This was a large send it experiment. I don't know the details but it took a while to build and was entirely collaborative in execution and drafted that day. 

We also performed tests on ribosomes and tRNA and it looks like those components were made successfully. 


# How to take these learnings back home? 

- What challenges might you expect?

Balancing my other comitment and running OnePot independently will be a challenge but maybe that's the point. As far as challenges for future workshops. I don't know how to 

- What details did you learn here that would be useful?

I was intrigued by the unit testing approach described by RK to ensure high quality of 36 pure. If we learned that we don't need dialysis exchange on tRNA that would be fantastic.   

- What kind of support would be useful?

It will be important and awesome to keep this sense of community alive. Through follow ups and regular support. I now feeling like I'd like to run OnePot end-to-end from buffer to GFP on my end and report the result to set an example. 

# Reflections on the workshop?

- What was your favorite moment?

The feeling of the schedule going off the rails and people being committed to finding a solution. The hierarchy was flattened, but we had built enough trust with each other that the hierarchy wasn't needed. I loved all the phrases that emerged from the workshop. "Pass the neuron", "We're in the chute now", the "vibosome", lofi cytosols to chill to

- What was your least favorite moment?

Always feeling that we might be pushing too hard. I would have liked to have done these reflection at the end of the day but there was no time. We needed to have done a better job at timing things out.
