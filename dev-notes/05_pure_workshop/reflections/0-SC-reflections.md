# Day 1 - small molecule reflection
Co-culture initiation:
I somehow wish I was there to see how you prepared the 36 individual cultures, just because it seems to be such a critical point in the further equilibrium of all the strains. Also very curious about how arbitrary is the amount of EF-TU that can be added to the culture, specially now that Anton showed me the spectrum of the PUREXPRESS composition, where the concentration of EF-TU is simply stupidly high.
I liked this thing of storing the pellet in a ziploc bag, it was funny but elegant.

Aminoacid prep:
I'm glad I was there! I probably would not have insisted that much on tyrosine dissolution if it weren't for the comments that we had no choice but to resuspend 100%. So that was quite long actually, vortexing wasn't very efficient, heating helped a bit, after that vortexing became more effective. There was stillmsome point where it was hard to assess if we were observing very small particles in suspension or air bubbles.

SMS:
The reconstitution was pretty straightforward. I added the components in order, except for TCEP that I think we all added at the end. I didn't have any particular care, I tend to work rather quickly to avoid breaking to much the cold chain. I vortexed again a lot the aminoacid solution in case there was still undissolved tyrosine. 

PURE reaction setup:
The order of the components was changed : first was Workshop SMS (vortexed a lot), then Mg(OAc)2, then BEB tRNA, the rest in order. I didn't do a lot of up and downs while assembling, I tried to avoid bubbles, assembled the components then did general up and down with a p20 when the whole reaction was set up.

# Day 2 - protein mix reflection
Sonication seems to be a point that needs to be re calibrated for each equipment and each experimental setup in a lab. Our sonicator is a QSonica125, for lysates I haven't had great results because I still need to calibrate the lysis steps. However for the sonication of recombinant proteins (approx 40mL of culture) here is the protocol that we use, with a thin probe:
1s ON - 4s OFF
40% amplitude
Time ON: 4-8mn according the protein (20-40mn total). We adjust the sonication time by searching for a change in the density of the lysate, often associated with a change of color (slight).
I don't have the amount of equivalent energy, I could write it down next time. 
I liked the use of gravity columns, much simpler than any fplc or even the peristaltic pumps we use. And way faster --> is that good though? Residence time of the buffers and the lysate in the column/resin?

Dialysis steps were helpful. I wasn't super comfortable with the use of Amicon and spin tubes for dialysis, now I have manipulated of all sizes :) It was interesting to calculate the amount of imidazole in each step. 


# Day 3 - rescue the protein mix by drop ins
I was a bit suprised by the issues we had with the Pierce660 kit, specially regarding Jake's results (twice). I'm not sure what was going here. 

The drop in experiment was actually great. It took us a while to design it, but I really feel that we were very careful in designing the controls and the different conditions, so that the experiment was actually useful, I mean interpretable. It has happened to me countless times that because of wanting to do something quicky I neglect the design and then I don't know if my experiment is actually answering the question I had. So I really feel that it was time that was worth investing. Now regarding the data it is difficult to assess how useful the supplementation was, however there was a tendency where several conditions of supplementation actually improved the expression of the reporter. IF2 seemed to play a relevant role and in some cases a two-fold increase was observed. Although the overall activity is marginal comparting to the commercial control, it still gives a hint. Now, ideal case would be to assess the statistical significance of the differences observed but it's not possible with so few points. 

# Day 4 - rescue the protein mix by dialysis
Despite not having an ultra centrfigue at my lab that can reach 100.000g, I have to admit that this step was cool and observing this translucid, glassy pellet and thinking "those are ribosomes" was awesome. AWESOME. AAAAWWWEEESSSSOOOMMMMEEE. (My labmates were impressed too, I sent a picture). 

tRNA precipitation was pretty cool too. It always amazes me that, at some point in the past, "someone" had the idea of doing those cycles of precipitation and resuspension using organic solvents and salts. With no internet, just books and limited conversations between fewer amount of scientists. Geniuses. Anyway, I did not how to handle phenol and it was stressful because I'm a clumsy person. But it was not complicated. Now I know, double gloves, longer coat, fume hood, use the cap of the bottle to avoid the drop falls, don't take anything that has touched Phenol out the cabin. In the end, again, seeing a white-ish pellet and thinking "those are tRNAs" was WOW. Pretty cool. I'm not sure this section is very useful for the future, but I'm tired. A big THANK YOU to the red team who assessed the usefulness of dialysis and found out it was not critical. It saved us like half a day. Actually, if it weren't because of that, we probably wouldn't have been able to make the big PURE experiment the day after. Also shoutout to Victoria, Adrianna and Han who still had the comittment to make fresh buffers at like midnight. I couldn't. Congratulations.

SPEAKING OF, this poisoning experiment was very funny. Also sad. But funny. Basically, adding 1uL of our protein mix killed 90-95% of the activity of the PURE mix. So yeah, best hint of the week. I mean, that's a good result because we can work on that, that was actually kind of motivating. Worst feeling is getting stuck. While there is a move, you're not stuck, so that was cool. But so surprising that even a low quantity of a component can be THAT detrimental to the activity. So, it kept me thinking (as someone who has never worked with PUREXPRESS) : is it that the commercial PURExpress is super sensitive and fragile when it comes to contaminants? Or is it that there was a stupidly high concentration of a contaminant in the reaction (since it was a low volume)? Dilaysis seemed the way to go. 

# Day 5 - assemble PURE

That day was about trying to put together all the hints we had during the week. Which was interesting because not planned initially like that - but nothing ever comes out as planned (and if it does, then there was no challenge in it). 

# How to take these learnings back home? 

- What challenges might you expect?

  Adjust the lysis protocol and look for a way of assessing it without positive controls. Can we think of systematic parameters that are indicators of a good lysis and that do not rely of examining visually our samples (only)?

  Clearly the ribosome purification protocol is something I don't how to replicate there. UPDATE: Fernán says that in the faculty of biology there IS an ultracentrifuge!!!

- What details did you learn here that would be useful?

  The low protein/DNA binding tubes. I generally do not pay attention to the kind of tubes I'm using. The advice of vortexing "agressively" the solution A/energy mix. 

- What kind of support would be useful?

# Reflections on the workshop?

- What was your favorite moment?

  Working as a team, asking a lot of questions to each other, comparing all the knacks we have, not knowing if they are necessary, if it is superstition, esotherism or if it indeed has a solid ground. 

- What was your least favorite moment?

  Please take care of this very fragile piece of optic in your nanodrop by GENTLY closing the lid :p
