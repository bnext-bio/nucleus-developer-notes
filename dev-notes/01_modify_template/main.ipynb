    "A shared understanding of how to interpret data from CFE systems would speed the development of measurements and standards towards improved reproducibility and address challenges in interpreting and comparing existing and future data, including data from failed experiments. Time-course measurements of the product expressed in the cytosol are favored over endpoint measurements, despite the time, labor, and costs involved, to obtain a more complete and informative view of a cytosol. This package helps to standardize the reporting of measurements as a reduced quantity, such as a mean value, with uncertainty and include a baseline from negative control measurements. The collection of such data enable reaction optimization and the development of predictive modeling tools."
