    "A shared understanding of how to interpret data from CFE systems would speed the development of measurements and standards towards improved reproducibility and address challenges in interpreting and comparing existing and future data, including data from failed experiments ([NIST, 2024](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1500-26)). Time-course measurements of the product expressed in the cytosol are favored over endpoint measurements, despite the time, labor, and costs involved, to obtain a more complete and informative view of a cytosol. This package helps to standardize the reporting of measurements as a reduced quantity, such as a mean value, with uncertainty and include a baseline from negative control measurements. The collection of such data enable reaction optimization and the development of predictive modeling tools.\n",

    "In order to make the most of this toolkit it is necessary to ensure that your has been designed following best practices to include replicates and controls. When designing an experiment we recommend following our platemap guide. Additionally, the following code makes some assumptions regarding the format of the incoming data. If you are using a Cytation instrument see our Getting started guide. Otherwise, it might be necessary to write some glue code to transform your raw data into a format compatible with this library. \n",

    "3. Steady state as calculated by the intercept of the $V_{max}$ line with the maximum data value. This tends to match our intuition about where the steady state is the least, but has pleasing symmetry with the way we calculate the lag time (intercept of $V_{max}$ with zero).\n",
