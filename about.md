Nucleus is a platform for sharing synthetic cell modules and tools for their development. The goal of the platform is to make available a set of core synthetic cell modules and methods for their use that are well-documented and accessible such that can be readily used and adapted by other practitioners.

Nucleus has a two-tier approach. The Nucleus Core includes contributions that have been validated by b.next for robustness and interoperability. The Nucleus Contributor page is where external contributions are made. This two-tiered approach makes it easy to contribute without compromising the quality and focus of the Core distribution. Overtime, we want to facilitate integration of community contributions into the Core, but this process will take time to get right and will be an act of co-creation between b.next and the community.

Our goal is to facilitate the growth of a thriving and collaborative synthetic cell industry. These practices will help to ensure that people can compete on creative things to do with synthetic cells and not on getting synthetic cells working in the first place.
