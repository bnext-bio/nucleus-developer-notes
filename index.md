Nucleus Developer Notes is an online platform maintained by bnext for sharing tools and know-how for building synthetic cells. Our notes are highly interactive, building on the work of open-source scientific programming communities.

Dev notes are a place for small but useful advances in cytosol and synthetic cell engineering. If you have validated an existing module in PURE; If you have developed a new software tool for characterizing liposome behavior; if you develop models of cytosols or synthetic cells,  share them with the community as a Dev Note. 

Dev notes integrate embedded video, interactive figures, executable code, and data content with accessible narrative description to ensure that science and engineering is communicated in a way that is maximally useful to other practitioners.
