Developer Notes (DevNotes) are a short form of scientific communication that can be described in one sentence. They provide the Nucleus community with a means to rapidly share useful results and insights. Since they are built on top of Jupyter Notebooks they can easily integrate code and a variety of file types, bundling an entire research workflow into a discrete package. Continuing developments made to the [Nucleus Distribution](https://bnext.bio/nucleus) by the Core Development Team at b.next or by visiting residents and fellows at Nucleus Labs will be reported here before being integrated into the Distribution.

If you work on synthetic cells and related systems and/or work with the Nucleus Distribution, you are invited to submit a DevNote. DevNotes are open access and open source. By contributing a DevNote you can contribute to the development of the Nucleus Distribution. Results and insights that are highly useful and/or relevant will be integrated into the Nucleus Distribution by the Core Development Team at b.next.
