Synthetic Biology
: An interdisciplinary field that combines biology, engineering, and computational methods to design and construct new biological parts, devices, and systems or to re-engineer existing biological systems.

Biobricks
: Standardized DNA sequences that can be assembled to build synthetic biological circuits or systems.

CRISPR-Cas9
: A genome editing tool derived from bacterial immune systems, enabling precise modification of DNA sequences in organisms.

Metabolic Engineering
: The practice of optimizing metabolic pathways within an organism to increase production of a desired substance, such as biofuels or pharmaceuticals.

Chassis Organism
: A host organism, often a microbe, engineered to perform specific functions or host synthetic biological circuits.

Gene Circuit
: A network of interacting genes and regulatory elements designed to perform specific computational or functional tasks within a cell.
