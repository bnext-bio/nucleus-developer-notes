## General terms

:::{glossary}

Cytosol
: Cytosols are the insides of synthetic cells, aqueous mixtures of “components” (e.g., proteins, RNAs, small organic molecules, and salts) that recapitulate user desired biological functions (e.g., transcription and translation).

Container
: Containers are the outsides of synthetic cells. Containers form a barrier between the interior (or “cytosols”) of synthetic cells and the environment, and are typically made of phospholipids forming a bilayer.

Module
: Modules are defined sets of DNA, RNA, and proteins that encode defined functions when implemented in cytosol or synthetic cells. [[Nucleus modules](https://github.com/bnext-bio/nucleus/tree/main/dna-distribution/v0.1.0-001)]

PURE
: PURE is a defined set of 108 molecules (proteins, RNAs, small organic molecules, and salts) that recapitulate transcription and translation.

OpenMTA
: The [OpenMTA](https://biobricks.org/openmta-faq/) is an easy-to-use legal tool that promotes exchange of biological materials. By removing blanket restrictions, the Open MTA aims to inspire innovation so that all people benefit from advances in biotechnology.

pT7-bjaI
: Expresses the enzyme bjaI under the T7 promoter transforming S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and isovaleryl-CoA (IV-CoA) into the quorum sensing small molecule  IV-HSL. [[sequence](https://github.com/bnext-bio/nucleus/blob/main/dna-distribution/v0.1.0-001/lacI.gb)]
