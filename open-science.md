## Sharing module DNA

All {term}`Module` DNA should be shared publicly, free of any patent-based restrictions that would prevent others from using that module for any purpose.

### Strongly recommended practices

- Module DNA should be described by a digital design file that is stored in an appropriate repository. Waiving such rights can be accomplished by sharing under a Creative Commons Public Domain Dedication (CC0) or Open Data Commons License equivalently permissive tool.
- Module DNA used in validation experiments should be sequence verified and the sequence data should be stored next to the design file. 
- Design files and sequence verification should be assigned a persistent identifier.
- Module DNA should be submitted to AddGene and, if possible, be made available under {term}`OpenMTA`.

## Sharing module data

{term}`Module` Data - meaning data supporting results about the expected behavior of the contributed module - should be shared publicly, free of any intellectual property or contractual restrictions that would prevent others from using that data.

### Strongly recommended practices

- Module Data should link characterization data with experimental conditions unambiguously.
- Module Data should be stored in an appropriate domain specific repository in such a way as to waive any intellectual property rights in that data to the extent allowed by law. Waiving such rights can be accomplished by sharing under a Creative Commons Public Domain Dedication (CC0) or equivalently permissive tool.
- Module Data should be assigned a persistent identifier (DOI)
- Module Data should be shared using open, machine-readable formats. If an appropriate format exists within the Nucleus CDK, that format should be used. 
- Module Data should adhere to FAIR principles. 

## Sharing open methods

{term}`Module` methods - meaning the protocols and tools necessary to replicate the described behavior of the Module - should be shared publicly free of any intellectual property or contractual restrictions that would prevent others from using the module. 

### Strongly recommended practices

- Where possible, protocols should adhere to standard Nucleus formats.
- Where compatible with high standards of research practice, projects should use open source software. And, where possible, projects should use existing Nucleus software. Where this is not possible, the methods used should be described in sufficient detail to enable others to replicate experiments and that description shared publicly.
- Where compatible with high standards of research practice, projects should use open methods (e.g., kits, assays, and experimental procedures that are not subject to intellectual property rights). And, where possible, projects should use existing Nucleus methods. - Where this is not possible, the methods used should be described in sufficient detail to enable others to replicate experiments and that description shared publicly.
- Where compatible with high standards of research practice, projects should use open materials and reagents (e.g., probes, cell lines, plasmids, antibodies). And, where possible, projects should use existing Nucleus plasmids. Where this is not possible, the materials used should be described in sufficient detail to enable others to replicate experiments and that description shared publicly.

## Sharing data narratives

Data narratives are descriptive texts that provide contextual information about expected behavior of modules and protocols. They serve to tie together the components described above (e.g. module DNA, data, protocols) into a cohesive whole.

### Strongly recommended practices

- Where possible, protocols should adhere to standard Nucleus formats
- Where possible, references to component DOIs should be made within the document
- Narratives should be submitted to the contributor page
- They should be submitted to the Nucleus contributor page
